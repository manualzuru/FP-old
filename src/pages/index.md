    Help communities prevent and respond quickly and effectively to crises
description: >-
  FightPandemics was born to make it easier for communities to access the information they need and coordinate responses in a more effective way. Specifically, this project aggregates collective intelligence before, during and after global and local crises such as public health emergencies

  On FightPandemics.com, everyone can share projects that are working well in their community, take each other’s ideas to apply where they live, create new projects and exchange anything that can help the society to fight pandemics.

        Connecting people and projects. Link potential investors with potential entrepreneurs, ideas to reduce the negative impacts of pandemics around the world to communities, etc. We are going to help communities prevent and respond quickly and effectively to crises over connections.

        Any idea that can have a positive effect on society can be helpful.

        For example, a Whatsapp group that helps a neighborhood, or even a startup creating a new application to map solutions. It does not matter the size or the simplicity, any project can help and is going to be welcome on this aggregator!

        This is not the first nor last pandemic. Currently, the information about the pandemic is highly fragmented, especially at the local level. Whereas one can find global information and trackers, it is difficult to find information that is relevant to your community. Furthermore, it is difficult for organizations, funders, companies, volunteers and local leaders to coordinate responses. This puts humanity and local communities at risk. FightPandemics was born to make communities more resilient to pandemics by facilitating access to information and coordinated responses.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
