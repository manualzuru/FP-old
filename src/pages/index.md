    Help communities prevent and respond quickly and effectively to crises

  This is not the first nor last pandemic. Currently, the information about the pandemic is highly fragmented, especially at the local level. Whereas one can find global information and trackers, it is difficult to find information that is relevant to your community. Furthermore, it is difficult for organizations, funders, companies, volunteers and local leaders to coordinate responses. This puts humanity and local communities at risk. FightPandemics was born to make communities more resilient to pandemics by facilitating access to information and coordinated responses.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
