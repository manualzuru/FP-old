This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# FightPandemics Overview

Currently, there is no easy way to find all the information at the local and global level for the different people that are affected by the pandemic, the different projects that need volunteers, the FREE or discounted tools for builders, the grants available and other relevant information. That's why Fight Pandemics was born.

## **Personas**

- **Sick or Vulnerable Individuals**

- **Individuals that want to contribute with time at the local and global lever**
    1. Local Support: find local groups that are that are helping with buying groceries (cooperatives, telegram, whatassap groups), 3D printing or any other local help outside of medical support.
    2. Global Support: find teams that are working on solutions for fighting the pandemic (Software, Content, Blockchain DAOs)
- I**ndividuals that want to contribute with other resources.**
    1. Global and local grants and funds by Governments, VCs, Angels and crowdunfing campaigns.
